## Overview
- The purpose of this Northcoders project was to work as a team to build a full stack project that included the use of technologies we had not yet seen/used as part of the bootcamp.
- We had to plan our ideas, spike new technologies, and finally come together as a group to make our chosen idea a reality.

## Features
- Our mobile app (iOS/Android) is intended to be a mood journal with a twist. Along with the ability to record your mood and notes daily, you can:
    - use the app to meditate with it's built in timer and backing audio
    - read about any negative emotions you may be feeling with the mood bios
    - be inspired by the daily quote
    - or inspire others by uploading quotes that you like, using the text/optical character recognition feature
- You can also:
    - save quotes, with the ability to view all saved quotes, and share them to other platforms
    - use the calendar to check previous journal entries
